# MyGameStore Front-End

This repository contains the front-end implementation of the MyGameStore project, which I built to reinforce and practice concepts of ReactJS and ExpressJS.

This project was implemented using ReactJS and the Material UI library. You can find details about the back-end implementation [here](https://github.com/marcosmatasousa/mygamesstore-backend)
