# MyGameStore Front-End

This repository contains the front-end implementation of the MyGameStore project, which I built to reinforce and practice concepts of ReactJS and ExpressJS.

This project was implemented using ReactJS and the Material UI library. You can find details about the back-end implementation [here](https://github.com/marcosmatasousa/mygamesstore-backend).

## How to run:

- Make sure you have NodeJS installed on your machine.
- Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
- Run `npm run build` to build the webapp.
- Run `npm run preview` to run the webapp.
- Finally, go to `localhost:5173` on your browser.
